# Windows-Forms-Calculator

This is a school project which calculates multiple operations.
When you click a number, it appears in the textbox, then you select the operation you want to do, and then click in the '=' (equal) button and finally the result appears in the textbox. There's a clear ('C') button too.

There's a lot to improve, since the calculator works with integer numbers only, making some results broken.
